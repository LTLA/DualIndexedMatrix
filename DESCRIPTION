Package: DualIndexedMatrix
Title: Fast Access to Matrix Rows and Columns
Description: Implements a DelayedArray seed that provides fast access to both
    the rows and columns of an arbitrary matrix representation. This is most 
    beneficial for indexing structures that are designed for efficient access in
    only one dimension. The general idea is to create two copies of the same
    data and to dynamically switch between them to efficiently access the 
    desired data.
